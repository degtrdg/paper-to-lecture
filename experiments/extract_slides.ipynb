    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome everyone. Today, I'll be presenting a summary and discussion of a significant research paper titled \"Deciphering Cancer Stemness in Tumors: A Novel Stemness Index for Oncogenic Dedifferentiation.\" This study was conducted by researchers who aimed to understand the role of stemness in cancer progression by developing new stemness indices. The findings have important implications for cancer biology and potential therapeutic approaches.\n",

    "# Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cancer progression** involves loss of differentiation and gain of stem-cell-like features.\n",
    "- **Stemness** refers to a cell's ability for self-renewal and differentiation.\n",
    "- Dedifferentiated tumors are often more aggressive and resistant to therapy.\n",
    "- The tumor microenvironment influences cancer stemness through hypoxia, cytokines, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, it's important to understand the concept of stemness in the context of cancer. Stemness is the property of a cell that allows it to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types. During cancer progression, cells often lose their differentiated features and acquire stem-cell-like characteristics, leading to more aggressive and treatment-resistant tumors. The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in this process by providing signals that can promote or inhibit stemness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Central Question\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Develop novel stemness indices to quantify oncogenic dedifferentiation.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Stemness indices derived from molecular profiles can reveal mechanisms of cancer dedifferentiation.\n",
    "- **Goals**:\n",
    "  - Create transcriptomic and epigenetic stemness indices.\n",
    "  - Analyze associations with oncogenic pathways, mutations, and the tumor microenvironment.\n",
    "  - Identify potential therapeutic targets and compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The central question addressed by this paper is whether novel stemness indices can be used to quantify the degree of dedifferentiation in tumors and uncover underlying biological mechanisms. The researchers hypothesized that these indices, based on gene expression and DNA methylation data, could provide insights into cancer stemness and its associations with various molecular and clinical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sources**:\n",
    "  - Non-tumor pluripotent stem cells and differentiated progeny profiles.\n",
    "  - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets (12,000 samples, 33 tumor types).\n",
    "- **Stemness Indices Development**:\n",
    "  - Used **One-Class Logistic Regression (OCLR)** machine-learning algorithm.\n",
    "  - Derived two indices:\n",
    "    - **mRNAsi**: mRNA expression-based stemness index.\n",
    "    - **mDNAsi**: DNA methylation-based stemness index.\n",
    "- **Validation**:\n",
    "  - Applied indices to external datasets and TCGA samples.\n",
    "  - Correlated indices with known stemness features and clinical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers utilized publicly available datasets, including profiles from stem cells and their differentiated progeny, as well as extensive data from TCGA. They developed two stemness indices using the OCLR algorithm—one based on mRNA expression (mRNAsi) and the other on DNA methylation (mDNAsi). These indices range from zero (low stemness) to one (high stemness). The indices were validated using external datasets and were applied to TCGA samples to explore associations with various molecular and clinical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# mRNA Expression-Based Stemness Index (mRNAsi)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation**:\n",
    "  - Higher mRNAsi in stem cells compared to differentiated cells.\n",
    "  - Stratified tumors by known stemness-related features.\n",
    "- **Findings**:\n",
    "  - High mRNAsi in germ-cell tumors, basal breast cancer, and lympho-hematopoietic cancers.\n",
    "  - Enrichment of stemness gene sets and cancer hallmarks.\n",
    "  - Positive correlation with core stem cell factors (MYC, OCT4, SOX2).\n",
    "  - Negative correlation with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mRNA-based stemness index (mRNAsi) effectively distinguished stem cells from differentiated cells. In tumors, higher mRNAsi values were observed in types known for their dedifferentiated phenotypes, such as germ-cell tumors and basal breast cancer. The index correlated positively with known stemness genes like MYC, OCT4, and SOX2, and negatively with EMT markers. This suggests that tumors with high mRNAsi maintain stem-cell-like characteristics and an epithelial phenotype.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# DNA Methylation-Based Stemness Index (mDNAsi)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Development**:\n",
    "  - Focused on hypomethylated stemness-specific enhancer regions.\n",
    "  - Identified 219 CpG probes associated with stemness.\n",
    "- **Findings**:\n",
    "  - Higher mDNAsi in stem cells compared to differentiated cells.\n",
    "  - Tumor samples showed varying degrees of stemness.\n",
    "  - High mDNAsi associated with hypomethylation at key pluripotency enhancers (e.g., SOX2-OCT4 motifs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNA methylation-based stemness index (mDNAsi) was developed by focusing on hypomethylated enhancer regions specific to stem cells. The index effectively differentiated stem cells from their differentiated counterparts. In tumors, high mDNAsi values were associated with hypomethylation at enhancers critical for maintaining pluripotency, such as those bound by SOX2 and OCT4. This indicates that DNA methylation patterns play a significant role in regulating cancer stemness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation Between mRNAsi and mDNAsi\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Correlation**:\n",
    "  - Positive correlation for most tumor types.\n",
    "- **Exceptions**:\n",
    "  - Negative correlation in lower-grade glioma (LGG), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), thymoma (THYM).\n",
    "- **Possible Explanation**:\n",
    "  - IDH1/2 mutations in gliomas leading to hypermethylation (G-CIMP phenotype).\n",
    "  - mDNAsi reflects epigenetic changes not captured by mRNAsi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "While mRNAsi and mDNAsi generally showed positive correlation across various tumor types, exceptions were found in gliomas and certain other cancers. In gliomas, IDH1/2 mutations cause widespread DNA hypermethylation, leading to lower mDNAsi despite high stemness indicated by mRNAsi. This suggests that mRNAsi and mDNAsi capture different aspects of cancer stemness, and both indices are valuable for a comprehensive understanding.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stemness and Tumor Stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breast Cancer (BRCA)**:\n",
    "  - High mRNAsi in basal subtype (aggressive, undifferentiated).\n",
    "  - Correlation with ER-negative status and TP53 mutations.\n",
    "- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**:\n",
    "  - High mRNAsi in less differentiated FAB subtypes (M0-M2).\n",
    "  - Low mRNAsi in more differentiated M3 subtype.\n",
    "- **Gliomas**:\n",
    "  - High mDNAsi associated with high-grade glioblastomas (GBMs).\n",
    "  - Correlation with aggressive molecular subtypes and poor prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the stemness indices to specific cancers demonstrated their ability to stratify tumors based on dedifferentiation. In breast cancer, high mRNAsi was associated with the basal subtype, known for its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In AML, the index correlated well with the degree of myeloid differentiation. In gliomas, high mDNAsi was linked to high-grade tumors and adverse clinical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pan-Cancer Stemness Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Associations with Mutations**:\n",
    "  - High mDNAsi linked to mutations in NSD1 (HNSC) and SETD2 (LUAD).\n",
    "- **MicroRNA and Protein Expression**:\n",
    "  - Correlation with miR-200 family, FOXM1, CYCLINB1.\n",
    "- **Clinical Features**:\n",
    "  - High stemness indices associated with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis in several cancers.\n",
    "- **Immune Microenvironment**:\n",
    "  - High stemness indices often associated with lower immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Across various cancers, the stemness indices revealed associations with key mutations, microRNA, and protein expression levels. For example, mutations in genes regulating epigenetics were linked to higher stemness, suggesting a role in dedifferentiation. High stemness was often correlated with higher tumor grades and worse clinical outcomes. Additionally, tumors with high stemness indices tended to have lower immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression, which may impact responses to immunotherapy.\n",

    "# Stemness in Metastases and Tumor Heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metastatic Tumors**:\n",
    "  - Generally higher mRNAsi compared to primary tumors.\n",
    "  - Indicates increased dedifferentiation in metastasis.\n",
    "- **Intratumor Heterogeneity**:\n",
    "  - Single-cell analyses showed variation in stemness within tumors.\n",
    "  - Greater heterogeneity observed in gliomas compared to breast cancers.\n",
    "- **Clinical Implications**:\n",
    "  - High stemness may contribute to therapy resistance and recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing primary tumors to metastases, metastatic samples typically exhibited higher stemness indices, suggesting that dedifferentiation plays a role in tumor spread. Single-cell analyses revealed significant intratumor heterogeneity in stemness, particularly in gliomas. This heterogeneity may contribute to challenges in treatment, as subpopulations of cancer stem cells can drive resistance and recurrence.\n",

    "# Stemness and the Immune Response\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Correlation**:\n",
    "  - High stemness indices associated with lower leukocyte fractions.\n",
    "  - Lower PD-L1 expression in tumors with high stemness.\n",
    "- **Immune Cell Populations**:\n",
    "  - Decreased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated immune cells.\n",
    "- **Implications for Immunotherapy**:\n",
    "  - Tumors with high stemness may be less responsive to checkpoint inhibitors.\n",
    "  - Potential need for combination therapies targeting both stemness and immune evasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The study found that tumors with high stemness indices often have fewer immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment and lower expression of PD-L1. This suggests that these tumors might evade immune detection and could be less responsive to immunotherapies that rely on activating immune cells. Understanding the relationship between stemness and the immune response is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies.\n",

    "  - Many compounds shared mechanisms targeting stemness pathways.\n",
    "- **Clinical Relevance**:\n",
    "  - Potential for repurposing existing drugs to target cancer stemness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "By using CMap analysis, the researchers identified several compounds that may inhibit cancer stemness. Notably, some of these compounds are already used clinically for other indications, such as dopamine receptor antagonists. This opens the possibility of repurposing existing drugs to target cancer stem cells, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes. The shared mechanisms of action among these compounds highlight key pathways that could be targeted in anti-stemness therapies.\n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer progression involves the gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor and stem-cell-like features. Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Stemness, defined as the potential for self-renewal and differentiation from the cell of origin, was originally attributed to normal stem cells that possess the ability to give rise to all cell types in the adult organism. Cancer progression involves gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor-like, stem-cell-like features. Undifferentiated primary tumors are more likely to result in cancer cell spread to distant organs, causing disease progression and poor prognosis, particularly because metastases are usually resistant to available therapies (Friedmann-Morvinski and Verma, 2014; Ge et al., 2017; Shibue and Weinberg, 2017; Visvader and Lindeman, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "An increasing number of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures have been associated with cancer stemness. Those molecular features are causally connected to particular oncogenic signaling pathways that regulate transcriptional networks that sustain the growth and proliferation of cancer cells (Ben-Porath et al., 2008; Eppert et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2010). Transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation of cancer cells frequently leads to oncogenic dedifferentiation and acquisition of stemness features by altering core signaling pathways that regulate the phenotypes of normal stem cells (Bradner et al., 2017; Young, 2011). Cell-extrinsic mechanisms can also affect maintenance of the undifferentiated state, largely through epigenetic mechanisms. Tumors comprise a complex, diverse, integrated ecosystem of relatively differentiated cancer cells, cancer stem cells, endothelial cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, and infiltrating immune cells, among other cell types. The microenvironment of a tumor, considered as a pathologically formed “organ,” is frequently characterized by hypoxia, as well as by abnormal levels of various cytokines, growth factors, and metabolites (Lyssiotis and Kimmelman, 2017). It provides numerous opportunities for cell-cell signals to modulate the epigenome and expression of stem-cell-like programs in cancer cells, frequently independent of their genetic backgrounds (Gingold et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has illuminated the landscapes of primary tumors by generating comprehensive molecular profiles composed of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and (post-translational) proteomic characteristics (Hoadley et al., 2014; Tomczak et al., 2015), along with histopathological and clinical annotations. The resulting resource enabled us to analyze cancer stemness quite extensively in almost 12,000 samples of 33 tumor types.\n",

      "First, we defined signatures to quantify stemness using publicly available molecular profiles from normal cell types that exhibit various degrees of stemness. By multi-platform analyses of their transcriptome, methylome, and transcription-factor binding sites using an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm (Sokolov et al., 2016), we obtained two independent stemness indices. One (mDNAsi) was reflective of epigenetic features; the other (mRNAsi) was reflective of gene expression. We then identified associations between the two stemness indices and novel oncogenic pathways, somatic alterations, and microRNA (miRNA) and transcriptional regulatory networks. Those features correlated with, and perhaps govern, cancer stemness in particular molecular subtypes of TCGA tumors. Importantly, higher values for stemness indices were associated with biological processes active in cancer stem cells and with greater tumor dedifferentiation, as reflected in histopathological grade. Metastatic tumor cells appeared more dedifferentiated phenotypically, probably contributing to their aggressiveness. We also found tumor heterogeneity at the single-cell level by measuring stemness in transcriptome profiles obtained from individual cancer cells. Using CIBERSORT to profile immune cell types in TCGA tumors, we obtained insight into the interface of the immune system with stemness. Finally, we identified compounds specific to selected molecular targets and mechanisms that may eventually lead to novel treatments that trigger differentiation and exhaust the stemness potential of highly aggressive neoplasms.\n",

      "**DNA-Methylation- and mRNA-Expression-Based Stemness Classifiers**\n",
      "\n",
      "We analyzed publicly available non-tumor and tumor datasets for which transcriptomic and epigenomic molecular profiles were available. We derived stemness indices using an OCLR algorithm trained on stem cell (ESC, embryonic stem cell; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell) classes and their differentiated ecto-, meso-, and endoderm progenitors. We chose OCLR because it does not penalize misclassification of stem-cell-derived progenitors at different stages of differentiation that still carry some of the undifferentiated features in their molecular profiles (its output was also validated against random forests). OCLR-based transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures were applied to TCGA datasets to calculate the mRNAsi and mDNAsi. Each stemness index (si) ranges from low (zero) to high (one) stemness. The tumor samples stratified by the indices were used for the integrative analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**mRNA Expression-Based Stemness Index**\n",
      "\n",
      "We validated the mRNAsi by applying it to an external dataset composed of both stem cells and somatic differentiated cells and by scoring molecular subtypes of breast cancers and gliomas that are characterized by different degrees of oncogenic dedifferentiation associated with pathology and clinical outcome. All stem cell samples attained higher stemness index values than samples from differentiated cells. TCGA tumors display various degrees of cancer stemness as revealed by mRNAsi and mDNAsi. Germ-cell tumors, basal breast cancer, and lympho-hematopoietic (Ly-Hem) cancers displayed highly dedifferentiated phenotypes in comparison to other tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we compared our signature to 16 gene sets that were associated with stemness in cancer and healthy cells in previous studies. These sets spanned 2,564 unique genes, with no two sets overlapping by more than 134 genes. In all cases, the published stemness gene sets were significantly enriched in mRNAsi. We found that “cancer hallmark” gene sets were significantly enriched, as were MYC targets, which significantly contributed to the positive side of the signature. This is consistent with MYC being one of the transcription factors that drive pluripotency in ESCs. Wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin and TGF-β signaling pathways were significantly enriched on the negative side of the stemness signature. This negative enrichment does not imply absence of specific signals in cancer stem cells, but rather that this signaling is lower relative to stem-cell-derived progenitors, as captured by the signature weights. This is again consistent with other GSEA results, as both signaling pathways are known mediators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism. We also computed the correlation of mRNAsi against mRNA expression of published pan-cancer EMT markers, which revealed significant correlations for most tumors. This is consistent with the biology of ESCs, which grow as epithelioid, polygonal cells in vitro and epithelial cancer precursors having stem-like properties. Importantly, most TCGA samples are primary tumors of an epithelial phenotype. Most skin melanoma cases come from lymph nodes, and this tumor type shows higher expression of vimentin, a key marker of a mesenchymal phenotype. mRNAsi is positively correlated with other core stem cell factors: EZH2, OCT4, and SOX2. Finally, Moonlight analysis of the oncogenic signatures from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) further validated our gene-expression-based index and confirmed engagement of MYC and EZH2, along with E2F3, MTOR, and SHH in driving oncogenic dedifferentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNA Methylation-Based Stemness Index**\n",
      "\n",
      "We defined the mDNAsi using OCLR by combining (1) supervised classification between ESCs/iPSCs and their progenies, (2) stem cell signatures associated with pluripotency-specific genomic enhancer elements based on ChromHMM from Roadmap, and (3) ELMER, which uses DNA methylation to identify enhancer elements and correlates their state with the expression of nearby genes. 219 CpG probes were selected in training OCLR using the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) datasets. By selecting probes previously defined to be active stemness-specific enhancers, we confirmed the ability of our approach to derive an mDNAsi. Since we focused exclusively on hypomethylated, functionally important CpG probes associated with stem cells, we further explored cis-activated genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We scored each TCGA sample using the mDNAsi and used an external dataset to confirm that stem cells had higher mDNAsi than differentiated samples. TCGA tumor types show different degrees of an inferred dedifferentiated phenotype. Within these, individual tumor samples show variation for cancer stemness. As anticipated, TCGA samples derived from the primary tumors show higher cancer stemness indices compared to non-tumor samples obtained from adjacent normal tissue of origin. Most of our selected probes fell within non-promoter elements, yet the SOX2-OCT4 transcription factor binding motif is one of the most highly enriched signatures within these regions. The SOX2-OCT4 complex is a critical master regulator of pluripotency and stemness and is highly enriched in tumor samples with high mDNAsi.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Correlations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the inputs for mDNAsi and mRNAsi are not necessarily complementary, we explored stratification of glioma samples by the epigenetically regulated mRNAsi (EREG-mRNAsi), a stemness index generated using a set of stemness-related epigenetically regulated genes. The EREG-mRNAsi, based on both RNA expression and epigenetics, elucidates the discrepancy between mDNAsi and mRNAsi and shows a positive correlation with both indices. Both mRNAsi and mDNAsi show good correspondence for a majority of tumors. We observed major discrepancies in the case of brain lower grade glioma (LGG), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and thymoma (THYM). For gliomas, mDNAsi is correlated positively with tumor pathology and clinical features, while mRNAsi shows a negative correlation. This result could arise from a high frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (IDH1/2) and resulting DNA hypermethylation.\n",

      "**Stemness Index Can Stratify Recognized Undifferentiated Cancers**\n",
      "\n",
      "We examined breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and gliomas to study if the mRNAsi/mDNAsi predict stemness in poorly differentiated tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In BRCA, we found a strong association between the stemness index and known clinical and molecular features. The mRNAsi was highest in the basal subtype, known to exhibit an aggressive phenotype associated with an undifferentiated state. BRCA samples with high mRNAsi were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and enriched for FAT3 and TP53 mutations. We noted that high mRNAsi was associated with higher protein expression of FOXM1, CYCLINB1, and MSH6, as well as higher miRNA-200 family expression. Invasive lobular type of BRCA (ILC), characterized by better prognosis in comparison to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), has a lower mRNAsi. We also applied our indices to non-TCGA BRCA samples and found a similar correlation between mRNAsi and mDNAsi in those samples. Moreover, mRNAsi also stratified BRCA samples with distinct histology in this dataset. Using datasets with estimated tumor cell type composition provided by the epigenetic deconvolution method, we found that both mRNAsi and mDNAsi were more highly correlated with malignant epithelial cells than with normal epithelial cells, suggesting that our indices identify distinct cancerous epithelial cell populations characterized by different features or degrees of stemness.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found an association between the mRNAsi, RNA expression subtypes previously defined by TCGA, and the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML. The mRNAsi showed the strongest correlation with the stage of myeloid differentiation of the AML samples. FAB subtypes M0 (undifferentiated), M1 (with minimal maturation), and M2 (with maturation) were characterized by high mRNAsi. In contrast, the M3 well-matured promyelocytic subtype, which is associated with benign chromosomal abnormalities and favorable clinical outcome, had low mRNAsi. High mRNAsi was associated with higher expression of miR-181c-3p, miR-22-3p, and miR-30b-3p.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a strong association between high mDNAsi, high pathologic grade, and recently published molecular subtypes of glioma. mDNAsi was low in less-aggressive gliomas that are characterized by codel and glioma CpG methylator phenotype (G-CIMP)-high features and was highest in highly aggressive glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs) characterized by IDH mutations (G-CIMP low) and poor clinical outcome. Also, high mDNAsi is strongly associated with more aggressive classical and mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, suggesting that it can stratify tumors with distinct clinical outcomes. We also found that high mDNAsi was associated with mutations in NF1 and EGFR and infrequent mutations in IDH1, TP53, CIC, and ATRX, with higher expression of ANNEXIN-A1 protein and lower expression of ANNEXIN-A7 and with expression of the miR-200 family.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtained similar results on non-TCGA glioma samples for which both mRNA expression and DNA methylation data were available. The negative correlation between mDNAsi and mRNAsi was restricted to LGG samples—specifically, the IDH mutant subtypes (G-CIMP high and codel). IDH1 mutations are known to reduce cell differentiation, and high values of the mRNAsi in a subset of IDH mutant gliomas might capture this phenomenon.\n",

      "**Pan-cancer Stemness Landscape**\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we tested the ability of our indices to identify previously unexplored features of cancer stemness across all TCGA tumors. First, we performed an enrichment analysis by sorting all TCGA samples by stemness index for each tumor type and looking for associations with mutations and molecular and clinical features. The most salient associations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi are presented, while the following results of the comprehensive analyses are shown in the supplementary material: associations with mutations, associations with miRNA expression and protein abundance, associations with the tumor grading, and clinical outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Correlations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi with Mutations in Genes, miRNA, and Expression of Proteins**\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a strong association of mDNAsi with known molecular subtypes, with somatic mutations in SETD2 and TP53 genes, and with tobacco smoking status in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Current smokers and recently reformed smokers have higher mDNAsi than non-smokers or long-term reformed smokers. This suggests that the stemness of LUAD tumors might be activated in response to environmental stimuli such as smoking and might influence the aggressiveness of the tumor. We also found an association between mDNAsi and higher protein expression of CYCLINB1 and FOXM1, which is a pro-stemness transcription factor upstream of CYCLINB1. FOXM1 has been associated with dedifferentiation in pancreatic cancer cells, as well as tumor proliferation in the kidney and ovarian cancers. Our result suggests that it could be a driver of dedifferentiation and proliferation in breast and lung cancers. Stemness of LUAD tumors is also associated with lower expression of ANNEXIN-A1. ANNEXIN-A1 has been indicated as a differentiation marker in pancreatic and urothelial cancers; therefore, we suspect that the relationship between ANNEXIN and FOXM1 expression and tumor differentiation may extend to other tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyses of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) samples revealed that high indices are correlated with NSD1 mutation, E-cadherin protein expression, miR-200-3p, and previously identified classical molecular subtypes. NSD1 mutation was recently linked in HNSC tumors to blockade of cellular differentiation and promotion of oncogenesis. Interestingly, miR-200 family members have been implicated in cancer initiation and metastasis, as well as self-renewal of healthy stem cells. HNSC tumors with high mDNAsi have reduced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) samples, we found an association between mRNAsi and high pathological grade. Negative associations between mRNAsi and the probability of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) were detected. In contrast to the majority of tumor types, LIHC samples with high mRNAsi have low expression of miR-200 family members. The miR-200 family is known to be associated with progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the miR-200b-ZEB1 circuit has been suggested as a master regulator of stemness in these cancers. We found associations of mRNAsi with higher CYCLINB1 and ACC1 and with lower PD-L1 and ANNEXIN-A1 protein expression in LIHC. ACC1 was associated with pathomorphological markers of LIHC aggressiveness (vascular invasion and poor differentiation), and its upregulation was correlated with poor OS and disease recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. LIHC samples with high mRNAsi were associated with specific genomic alterations (e.g., TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed analyses of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) samples revealed an association between high mRNAsi and defined molecular subtypes, clinical stage, and mutations in PRKAR1A and TP53 genes. We found a positive correlation between mRNAsi and adrenal differentiation score that is based on expression of 25 genes that are important for adrenal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stemness Indices Are Correlated with Tumor Pathology and Predictive of Clinical Outcome**\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed a positive correlation between tumor histology and pathology grading and both stemness indices for the majority of the TCGA cases. For mRNAsi, the most significant correlations were found for BRCA (IDC and ILC), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), LIHC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Interestingly, mRNAsi shows low values in GBM and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). On the other hand, mDNAsi strongly stratifies glioma by the pathology grade, culminating with the highest value for GBM. The reversed values of mDNAsi and mRNAsi in the case of gliomas were also evident in the clinical data analyses. We found a positive correlation between previously published glioma subtypes and mDNAsi, suggesting that mDNAsi might recapitulate prognostic molecular subtypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discordance between the mRNAsi and the mDNAsi for gliomas may be explained in part by the dominant genomic alteration associated with the LGG tumor type. Roughly 80% of LGG tumors carry an IDH1/2 mutation and, as demonstrated by our group and others, confer a genome-wide hypermethylator phenotype (G-CIMP). Given that the mDNAsi is driven primarily by low methylation levels associated with the stemness phenotype, the LGG tumors might resemble non-stem-like phenotypes, which are predominantly hypermethylated. The subgroup of G-CIMP with the lowest overall DNA methylation levels (G-CIMP low) is associated with the worst outcomes. Compared to G-CIMP-high tumors, G-CIMP-low tumors are known to be more proliferative, express cell-cycle-related genes, and have various stem-cell-like genomic features.\n",

      "**Cancer Stemness Indices Are Higher in Tumor Metastases and Reveal Intratumor Heterogeneity**\n",
      "\n",
      "The TCGA samples are derived mostly from primary tumors, except for skin melanoma, for which tissues are mostly metastatic lymph nodes. We used the mRNAsi to interrogate the MET500 dataset comprising expression profiles from 500 metastatic samples obtained from 22 different organs. In most cases, mRNAsi was significantly higher in metastatic samples compared to primary TCGA tumors. Prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastases had the most dedifferentiated phenotypes and are also more aggressive and resistant to therapies in contrast to primary tumors. Weaker association with the mRNAsi was due to a small number of available samples. Interestingly, testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) present the less differentiated phenotypes in primary tumors when compared to distant metastases. Primary TGCT tumor cells have high mRNAsi and may differentiate when metastasizing to distant organs. A similar trend was observed for STAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using another dataset, we found that mDNAsi was significantly higher in glioma samples obtained at first recurrence in contrast to primary gliomas. Our results reveal significant dedifferentiation of glioma cancer cells that contribute to glioma recurrence, which is frequently associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. By taking advantage of single-cell transcriptome datasets, we used mRNAsi to probe tumor heterogeneity for oncogenic dedifferentiation of individual cancer cells. We revealed high variation of stemness in the glioma and breast primary tumors. Individual glioma cells showed higher variation of oncogenic dedifferentiation in comparison to breast cancer cells. Single cells from metastases had higher stemness index in breast cancer. Interestingly, the negative correlation of EMT signature and stemness that we observed in TCGA primary tumors was also found in metastatic samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stemness Index Evaluated in the Context of Immune Response**\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that for many tumors, higher stemness indices are associated with a reduced leukocyte fraction and lower PD-L1 expression. For mDNAsi, the most distinctive negative correlations were found in the PanCan-12 squamous cluster (LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; HNSC; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma) and in GBM. For the mRNAsi, the highest negative correlation values were seen in GBM/LGG, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), LIHC, and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) tumors. We expect that such tumors will be less susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade treatments due to insufficient immune cell infiltration or preexisting downregulation of the PD-L1 pathway, which makes further inhibition ineffective. Our findings are consistent with previous reports showing a strong correlation between PD-L1 protein expression and infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We further explored correlations between stemness and immune microenvironment variables in the context of molecular subtypes of tumors. Several tumor types exhibit strong (positive or negative) correlations. Except for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), the association between stemness and PD-L1 expression and leukocyte fraction is readily apparent from the increasing and decreasing trends of individual variables across the molecular subtypes. For example, we found mesenchymal tumors to have the highest PD-L1 expression levels, the most significant leukocyte fractions, and the lowest mDNAsi compared to other HNSC subtypes, suggesting potential susceptibility to checkpoint blockade inhibitors. The use of immunotherapy for HNSC tumors is under active investigation with the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab; however, whether the effectiveness of therapy is limited to specific HNSC molecular subtypes is not clear from those reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assess other relationships between stemness and tumor microenvironment, we computed correlations between stemness indices and individual types of immune cells. By applying CIBERSORT, we scored 22 immune cell types for their relative abundance in TCGA tumor samples. These cell types included natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic and mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. We also obtained absolute estimates by scaling their relative abundance by overall leukocyte infiltration in each tumor as determined by ESTIMATE applied to DNA methylation data. For any given TCGA sample, we calculated the correlation between mDNAsi/mRNAsi and the estimated fraction of individual immune cell types. In addition to individual immune subpopulation fractions, we considered the functional activation of distinct cells by measuring the difference between activated and resting fractions of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. This approach was motivated by recent observations that activation of peripheral CD4+ T cells triggered by immunotherapy is responsible for the specific killing of tumor cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the squamous cluster tumors had a negative correlation between stemness and the fraction of CD4+ T cell populations, the activation state of the CD4+ T cells was higher in dedifferentiated tumors. This finding is consistent with our observation that PD-L1 protein expression is lower in these tumors, suggesting again that immune checkpoint blockade might be ineffective, and an additional mechanism of immune evasion may be operative. The opposite trend is present in thymomas, where PD-L1 protein expression and the fraction of the CD4+ T cell population are positively correlated with tumor dedifferentiation. Likewise, the activation state of CD4+ T cells is lower in dedifferentiated tumors, suggesting that they might be more susceptible to immunotherapy treatments.\n",

      "\n",
      "We employed the Connectivity Map (CMap), a data-driven, systematic approach for discovering associations among genes, chemicals, and biological conditions, to search for candidate compounds that might target pathways associated with stemness. We found enrichment for compounds associated with stemness in at least three cancer types. Five compounds are significantly enriched in more than 10 cancer types and have been reported to inhibit stemness-related tumorigenicity: the dopamine receptor antagonists thioridazine and prochlorperazine, the Wnt signaling inhibitor pyrvinium, the HSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin, and the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. Further, the telomerase inhibitor gossypol induced apoptosis and growth inhibition of cancer stem cells (CSCs), and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A (SAHA) reduced glioblastoma stem cell growth. According to our analysis, pyrvinium and puromycin could inhibit stemness in LUAD. We found several candidates with recognized anti-CSC activity for HNSC, including the aforementioned compounds. For LIHC, thioridazine, a prospective inhibitor of lung cancer stem cells, pyrvinium, puromycin, prochlorperazine, and others are potential compounds targeting undifferentiated tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMap mode-of-action (MoA) analysis of the 74 compounds revealed 56 mechanisms of action shared by the above compounds. Five compounds (fluspirilene, pimozide, prochlorperazine, thioridazine, and trifluoperazine) shared the MoA of dopamine receptor antagonist. We observed that entinostat, trichostatin-a, and vorinostat shared MoA as HDAC inhibitors, and LY-294002, zaprinast, zardaverine share MoA as phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMap target analysis revealed 212 distinct drug-target genes shared by the mentioned compounds.

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "\n",
      "This study is based on integrated analysis of cancer stemness in almost 12,000 primary human tumors of 33 different cancer types. We interrogated TCGA data for mutations, DNA methylation, expression of mRNA and miRNA, expression and post-translational modification of proteins, histopathological grade, and clinical outcome. Applying CIBERSORT, we gained insight into the tumor microenvironment and composition of immune cell infiltrates. By applying a machine-learning algorithm to molecular datasets from normal stem cells and their progeny, we developed two different molecular metrics of stemness and then used them to assess epigenomic and transcriptomic features of TCGA cancers according to their grade of oncogenic dedifferentiation. Ultimately, the analyses led us to potentially actionable targets (and their MoAs) as candidates for possible differentiation therapy of solid tumors and metastases. Our approach could be applied to longitudinal study of samples from primary, recurrent, and metastatic cancers, and gene expression signatures identified in the tumor samples can be used to interrogate CMap to suggest actionable targets and inhibitors for further analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which molecular PCBC datasets comprised of stem cells and defined populations of their differentiated progeny have been leveraged to develop a classification tool and machine-learning algorithm for analysis of a spectrum of human malignancies. A number of cancer stemness scores, based on genes that are differentially expressed between CSCs and non-CSCs, have been published and are relevant to clinical outcomes in AML (Eppert et al., 2011; Gentles et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2016). In those studies, gene sets enriched in ESCs (e.g., targets of NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and c-MYC) were frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors compared with well-differentiated ones. In breast cancers, those gene sets were associated with high-grade estrogen receptor-negative, basal-like tumors and poor clinical outcome (Ben-Porath et al., 2008). Another web-based tool, StemChecker, uses a curated set of 49 published stemness signatures defined by gene expression, RNAi screens, transcription factor binding sites, text mining of the literature, and other computational approaches. But it has been tested only for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In that case, high expression of stemness genes correlated with poor prognosis (Pintó et al., 2015). All previous studies were transcriptome-based and limited to a narrow set of genes and a small number of tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the present study, we found oncogenic dedifferentiation to be associated with several characteristics: mutations in genes that encode oncogenes and epigenetic modifiers, perturbations in specific mRNA/miRNA transcriptional networks, and deregulation of signaling pathways. Cancer stemness also appeared to involve core expression of MYC, OCT4, SOX2, and other genes involved in the regulatory circuitry that underlies normal and malignant self-renewal potential. Our indices derived from mRNA expression and DNA methylation signatures reliably stratified tumors of known stemness phenotype. High mRNAsi was associated with basal breast carcinomas but also Her2 and lumB subtypes that are more aggressive than the hormone-dependent lumA group. In contrast, high mDNAsi was strongly associated with high-grade glioblastomas, poor OS, and PFS. The association between stemness signatures and adverse outcome for some tumor types, including gliomas, may reflect malignant cell origins or the impact of their microenvironment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dedifferentiated cells can arise from different sources: from long-lived stem or progenitor cells that accumulate mutations in oncogenic pathways or via dedifferentiation from non-stem cancer cells that convert to CSCs through deregulation of developmental and/or non-developmental pathways. It is important to distinguish between the inherent stemness of CSCs and dedifferentiation induced by the tumor microenvironment. However, addressing that issue would require further validation beyond the scope of this study using other genomic datasets and/or laboratory experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both stemness indices were lowest in normal cells, increased in primary tumors, and highest in metastases, consistent with the idea that tumor progression generally involves oncogenic dedifferentiation. Interestingly, we observed negative associations between stemness and EMT gene signatures. The relationship between EMT and stemness remains a hotly debated topic, with several studies showing that EMT is necessarily associated with stemness (Fabregat et al., 2016). However, most TCGA data are obtained from primary tumors, which exist in a pre-EMT state, since EMT is strongly associated with tumor progression and with metastasis for many tumor types. Cancer cells in many primary solid tumors are basically epithelial regardless of their degrees of dedifferentiation, but some cells in such contexts could acquire mesenchymal characteristics either by accumulating additional mutations or by undergoing epigenetic changes shaped by the tumor microenvironment. Those mesenchymal cells can traverse the underlying tissue, enter the bloodstream, and seed distant organs, where they reacquire an epithelial phenotype to form metastatic tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed epithelial phenotypes and increased stemness index in molecular profiles of tumor-type-matched metastatic samples in the MET500 cohort. This portends an association between dedifferentiation and spread of tumor cells to distant organs. The observation is further supported by high mDNAsi in samples from recurrent gliomas. It appears that tumor growth de novo, or at recurrence/metastasis, is associated with an increased stemness phenotype. Decreased mRNAsi levels seen in TGCT suggest its possible differentiation as a germ cell tumor type induced by the microenvironment of liver or lung parenchyma, the organs it most often colonizes. Clinically, in general, tumor progression is associated with greater aggressiveness and resistance to therapy of almost all types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mRNAsi was high for individual primary glioma and breast cancer cells. Interestingly, when applied to transcriptomic profiles obtained from analysis of single cancer cells in bulk tumors, stemness indices revealed a high degree of intratumor heterogeneity with respect to dedifferentiation phenotype. The heterogeneity was greater in gliomas than in breast cancer, suggesting that intratumor environment, including stromal cells, hypoxia, and infiltration of immune cells, may play a role in shaping CSC niches and affect cancer cell developmental plasticity. Further molecular analyses of cancer cells stratified by the stemness phenotype would provide novel insights into the biology of primary tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that for a number of tumor types (GBM, LUSC, HNSC, and BLCA), higher mDNAsi was associated with reduced leukocyte fraction and/or lower PD-L1 expression. Such tumors are expected to be less susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade, due either to insufficient immune cell infiltration of tumors or to inherent downregulation of the PD-L1 pathway. Both factors can render immune checkpoint immunotherapy ineffective. The interaction between PD-L1 on cancer cells and PD1 receptor on T cells helps cancer cells elude the immune system by preventing activation of cytotoxic T cells in lymph nodes and subsequent recruitment of other immune cell types to the tumor site (Chen and Mellman, 2013). The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and/or PD-L1 expression correlates with aggressiveness in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Bertucci et al., 2015) and breast carcinomas (Poloñia et al., 2017). Common features shared between cancer cells and stem cells in the context of the immune response are being highlighted by a growing number of studies showing that vaccination with ESCs or iPSCs can raise specific immune response against cancer cells (Kooreman et al., 2018). That finding may indicate that both cell populations use protein networks that, in tumors, result in uncontrolled self-renewal and dedifferentiated phenotypes histopathologically defined by loss of architecture specific to the tissue of origin. We speculate that the indices described here may help predict the efficacy of stem-cell-based immunotherapies and contribute to the identification of patients who will respond to such therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We interrogated CMap using the gene expression signatures from tumor samples with the highest and lowest mRNAsi levels. Surprisingly, the CMap analysis, which is based on only a limited number of treated cell lines, very precisely selected drugs that have been shown to affect cancer stem cells with specificity. These translational analyses may ultimately pave the way for implementation of differentiation therapies for solid tumors. Here, we have also shown that cancer hallmarks can be extracted from datasets on cells with defined phenotypes and used to train machine-learning methods applicable to index molecular profiles of cancer. Our mRNAsi and mDNAsi can be translated into stemness scores (e.g., STEM50) that stratify tumors based on their dedifferentiation features, thus providing biomarkers for prediction of patient outcomes and response to differentiation therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By defining new metrics of cancer stemness and using them to interrogate TCGA datasets, our results provide a comprehensive characterization of dedifferentiation as new and significant hallmarks of cancer. The strengths of the approach are that it leverages features of dedifferentiated cells across a spectrum of tumor types that reflect tumor pathology and, in some cases, clinical outcome. This study also provides strategies for integrated analysis of cancer genomics based on machine-learning methods trained on molecular profiles obtained from cells with defined phenotypes. The findings based on those methods may advance the development of objective diagnostics tools for quantitating cancer stemness in clinical tumors, perhaps leading eventually to new biomarkers that predict tumor recurrence, guide treatment selection, or improve responses to therapy.\n",

      "Welcome everyone. Today, I'll be presenting a summary and discussion of a significant research paper titled \"Deciphering Cancer Stemness in Tumors: A Novel Stemness Index for Oncogenic Dedifferentiation.\" This study was conducted by researchers who aimed to understand the role of stemness in cancer progression by developing new stemness indices. The findings have important implications for cancer biology and potential therapeutic approaches.\n",

      "# Introduction and Background\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cancer progression** involves loss of differentiation and gain of stem-cell-like features.\n",
      "- **Stemness** refers to a cell's ability for self-renewal and differentiation.\n",
      "- Dedifferentiated tumors are often more aggressive and resistant to therapy.\n",
      "- The tumor microenvironment influences cancer stemness through hypoxia, cytokines, and other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, it's important to understand the concept of stemness in the context of cancer. Stemness is the property of a cell that allows it to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types. During cancer progression, cells often lose their differentiated features and acquire stem-cell-like characteristics, leading to more aggressive and treatment-resistant tumors. The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in this process by providing signals that can promote or inhibit stemness.\n",

      "The central question addressed by this paper is whether novel stemness indices can be used to quantify the degree of dedifferentiation in tumors and uncover underlying biological mechanisms. The researchers hypothesized that these indices, based on gene expression and DNA methylation data, could provide insights into cancer stemness and its associations with various molecular and clinical features.\n",

They developed two stemness indices using the OCLR algorithm—one based on mRNA expression (mRNAsi) and the other on DNA methylation (mDNAsi). These indices range from zero (low stemness) to one (high stemness). The indices were validated using external datasets and were applied to TCGA samples to explore associations with various molecular and clinical features.\n",

In tumors, higher mRNAsi values were observed in types known for their dedifferentiated phenotypes, such as germ-cell tumors and basal breast cancer. The index correlated positively with known stemness genes like MYC, OCT4, and SOX2, and negatively with EMT markers. This suggests that tumors with high mRNAsi maintain stem-cell-like characteristics and an epithelial phenotype.\n",

For example, mutations in genes regulating epigenetics were linked to higher stemness, suggesting a role in dedifferentiation. High stemness was often correlated with higher tumor grades and worse clinical outcomes. Additionally, tumors with high stemness indices tended to have lower immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression, which may impact responses to immunotherapy.\n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer progression involves the gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor and stem-cell-like features. Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Stemness, defined as the potential for self-renewal and differentiation from the cell of origin, was originally attributed to normal stem cells that possess the ability to give rise to all cell types in the adult organism. Cancer progression involves gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor-like, stem-cell-like features. Undifferentiated primary tumors are more likely to result in cancer cell spread to distant organs, causing disease progression and poor prognosis, particularly because metastases are usually resistant to available therapies (Friedmann-Morvinski and Verma, 2014; Ge et al., 2017; Shibue and Weinberg, 2017; Visvader and Lindeman, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "An increasing number of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures have been associated with cancer stemness. Those molecular features are causally connected to particular oncogenic signaling pathways that regulate transcriptional networks that sustain the growth and proliferation of cancer cells (Ben-Porath et al., 2008; Eppert et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2010). Transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation of cancer cells frequently leads to oncogenic dedifferentiation and acquisition of stemness features by altering core signaling pathways that regulate the phenotypes of normal stem cells (Bradner et al., 2017; Young, 2011). Cell-extrinsic mechanisms can also affect maintenance of the undifferentiated state, largely through epigenetic mechanisms. Tumors comprise a complex, diverse, integrated ecosystem of relatively differentiated cancer cells, cancer stem cells, endothelial cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, and infiltrating immune cells, among other cell types. The microenvironment of a tumor, considered as a pathologically formed “organ,” is frequently characterized by hypoxia, as well as by abnormal levels of various cytokines, growth factors, and metabolites (Lyssiotis and Kimmelman, 2017). It provides numerous opportunities for cell-cell signals to modulate the epigenome and expression of stem-cell-like programs in cancer cells, frequently independent of their genetic backgrounds (Gingold et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has illuminated the landscapes of primary tumors by generating comprehensive molecular profiles composed of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and (post-translational) proteomic characteristics (Hoadley et al., 2014; Tomczak et al., 2015), along with histopathological and clinical annotations. The resulting resource enabled us to analyze cancer stemness quite extensively in almost 12,000 samples of 33 tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we defined signatures to quantify stemness using publicly available molecular profiles from normal cell types that exhibit various degrees of stemness. By multi-platform analyses of their transcriptome, methylome, and transcription-factor binding sites using an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm (Sokolov et al., 2016), we obtained two independent stemness indices. One (mDNAsi) was reflective of epigenetic features; the other (mRNAsi) was reflective of gene expression. We then identified associations between the two stemness indices and novel oncogenic pathways, somatic alterations, and microRNA (miRNA) and transcriptional regulatory networks. Those features correlated with, and perhaps govern, cancer stemness in particular molecular subtypes of TCGA tumors. Importantly, higher values for stemness indices were associated with biological processes active in cancer stem cells and with greater tumor dedifferentiation, as reflected in histopathological grade. Metastatic tumor cells appeared more dedifferentiated phenotypically, probably contributing to their aggressiveness. We also found tumor heterogeneity at the single-cell level by measuring stemness in transcriptome profiles obtained from individual cancer cells. Using CIBERSORT to profile immune cell types in TCGA tumors, we obtained insight into the interface of the immune system with stemness. Finally, we identified compounds specific to selected molecular targets and mechanisms that may eventually lead to novel treatments that trigger differentiation and exhaust the stemness potential of highly aggressive neoplasms.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNA-Methylation- and mRNA-Expression-Based Stemness Classifiers**\n",
      "\n",
      "We analyzed publicly available non-tumor and tumor datasets for which transcriptomic and epigenomic molecular profiles were available. We derived stemness indices using an OCLR algorithm trained on stem cell (ESC, embryonic stem cell; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell) classes and their differentiated ecto-, meso-, and endoderm progenitors. We chose OCLR because it does not penalize misclassification of stem-cell-derived progenitors at different stages of differentiation that still carry some of the undifferentiated features in their molecular profiles (its output was also validated against random forests). OCLR-based transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures were applied to TCGA datasets to calculate the mRNAsi and mDNAsi. Each stemness index (si) ranges from low (zero) to high (one) stemness. The tumor samples stratified by the indices were used for the integrative analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**mRNA Expression-Based Stemness Index**\n",
      "\n",
      "We validated the mRNAsi by applying it to an external dataset composed of both stem cells and somatic differentiated cells and by scoring molecular subtypes of breast cancers and gliomas that are characterized by different degrees of oncogenic dedifferentiation associated with pathology and clinical outcome. All stem cell samples attained higher stemness index values than samples from differentiated cells. TCGA tumors display various degrees of cancer stemness as revealed by mRNAsi and mDNAsi. Germ-cell tumors, basal breast cancer, and lympho-hematopoietic (Ly-Hem) cancers displayed highly dedifferentiated phenotypes in comparison to other tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we compared our signature to 16 gene sets that were associated with stemness in cancer and healthy cells in previous studies. These sets spanned 2,564 unique genes, with no two sets overlapping by more than 134 genes. In all cases, the published stemness gene sets were significantly enriched in mRNAsi. We found that “cancer hallmark” gene sets were significantly enriched, as were MYC targets, which significantly contributed to the positive side of the signature. This is consistent with MYC being one of the transcription factors that drive pluripotency in ESCs. Wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin and TGF-β signaling pathways were significantly enriched on the negative side of the stemness signature. This negative enrichment does not imply absence of specific signals in cancer stem cells, but rather that this signaling is lower relative to stem-cell-derived progenitors, as captured by the signature weights. This is again consistent with other GSEA results, as both signaling pathways are known mediators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism. We also computed the correlation of mRNAsi against mRNA expression of published pan-cancer EMT markers, which revealed significant correlations for most tumors. This is consistent with the biology of ESCs, which grow as epithelioid, polygonal cells in vitro and epithelial cancer precursors having stem-like properties. Importantly, most TCGA samples are primary tumors of an epithelial phenotype. Most skin melanoma cases come from lymph nodes, and this tumor type shows higher expression of vimentin, a key marker of a mesenchymal phenotype. mRNAsi is positively correlated with other core stem cell factors: EZH2, OCT4, and SOX2. Finally, Moonlight analysis of the oncogenic signatures from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) further validated our gene-expression-based index and confirmed engagement of MYC and EZH2, along with E2F3, MTOR, and SHH in driving oncogenic dedifferentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNA Methylation-Based Stemness Index**\n",
      "\n",
      "We defined the mDNAsi using OCLR by combining (1) supervised classification between ESCs/iPSCs and their progenies, (2) stem cell signatures associated with pluripotency-specific genomic enhancer elements based on ChromHMM from Roadmap, and (3) ELMER, which uses DNA methylation to identify enhancer elements and correlates their state with the expression of nearby genes. 219 CpG probes were selected in training OCLR using the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) datasets. By selecting probes previously defined to be active stemness-specific enhancers, we confirmed the ability of our approach to derive an mDNAsi. Since we focused exclusively on hypomethylated, functionally important CpG probes associated with stem cells, we further explored cis-activated genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We scored each TCGA sample using the mDNAsi and used an external dataset to confirm that stem cells had higher mDNAsi than differentiated samples. TCGA tumor types show different degrees of an inferred dedifferentiated phenotype. Within these, individual tumor samples show variation for cancer stemness. As anticipated, TCGA samples derived from the primary tumors show higher cancer stemness indices compared to non-tumor samples obtained from adjacent normal tissue of origin. Most of our selected probes fell within non-promoter elements, yet the SOX2-OCT4 transcription factor binding motif is one of the most highly enriched signatures within these regions. The SOX2-OCT4 complex is a critical master regulator of pluripotency and stemness and is highly enriched in tumor samples with high mDNAsi.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Correlations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the inputs for mDNAsi and mRNAsi are not necessarily complementary, we explored stratification of glioma samples by the epigenetically regulated mRNAsi (EREG-mRNAsi), a stemness index generated using a set of stemness-related epigenetically regulated genes. The EREG-mRNAsi, based on both RNA expression and epigenetics, elucidates the discrepancy between mDNAsi and mRNAsi and shows a positive correlation with both indices. Both mRNAsi and mDNAsi show good correspondence for a majority of tumors. We observed major discrepancies in the case of brain lower grade glioma (LGG), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and thymoma (THYM). For gliomas, mDNAsi is correlated positively with tumor pathology and clinical features, while mRNAsi shows a negative correlation. This result could arise from a high frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (IDH1/2) and resulting DNA hypermethylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stemness Index Can Stratify Recognized Undifferentiated Cancers**\n",
      "\n",
      "We examined breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and gliomas to study if the mRNAsi/mDNAsi predict stemness in poorly differentiated tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In BRCA, we found a strong association between the stemness index and known clinical and molecular features. The mRNAsi was highest in the basal subtype, known to exhibit an aggressive phenotype associated with an undifferentiated state. BRCA samples with high mRNAsi were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and enriched for FAT3 and TP53 mutations. We noted that high mRNAsi was associated with higher protein expression of FOXM1, CYCLINB1, and MSH6, as well as higher miRNA-200 family expression. Invasive lobular type of BRCA (ILC), characterized by better prognosis in comparison to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), has a lower mRNAsi. We also applied our indices to non-TCGA BRCA samples and found a similar correlation between mRNAsi and mDNAsi in those samples. Moreover, mRNAsi also stratified BRCA samples with distinct histology in this dataset. Using datasets with estimated tumor cell type composition provided by the epigenetic deconvolution method, we found that both mRNAsi and mDNAsi were more highly correlated with malignant epithelial cells than with normal epithelial cells, suggesting that our indices identify distinct cancerous epithelial cell populations characterized by different features or degrees of stemness.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found an association between the mRNAsi, RNA expression subtypes previously defined by TCGA, and the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML. The mRNAsi showed the strongest correlation with the stage of myeloid differentiation of the AML samples. FAB subtypes M0 (undifferentiated), M1 (with minimal maturation), and M2 (with maturation) were characterized by high mRNAsi. In contrast, the M3 well-matured promyelocytic subtype, which is associated with benign chromosomal abnormalities and favorable clinical outcome, had low mRNAsi. High mRNAsi was associated with higher expression of miR-181c-3p, miR-22-3p, and miR-30b-3p.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a strong association between high mDNAsi, high pathologic grade, and recently published molecular subtypes of glioma. mDNAsi was low in less-aggressive gliomas that are characterized by codel and glioma CpG methylator phenotype (G-CIMP)-high features and was highest in highly aggressive glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs) characterized by IDH mutations (G-CIMP low) and poor clinical outcome. Also, high mDNAsi is strongly associated with more aggressive classical and mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, suggesting that it can stratify tumors with distinct clinical outcomes. We also found that high mDNAsi was associated with mutations in NF1 and EGFR and infrequent mutations in IDH1, TP53, CIC, and ATRX, with higher expression of ANNEXIN-A1 protein and lower expression of ANNEXIN-A7 and with expression of the miR-200 family.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtained similar results on non-TCGA glioma samples for which both mRNA expression and DNA methylation data were available. The negative correlation between mDNAsi and mRNAsi was restricted to LGG samples—specifically, the IDH mutant subtypes (G-CIMP high and codel). IDH1 mutations are known to reduce cell differentiation, and high values of the mRNAsi in a subset of IDH mutant gliomas might capture this phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pan-cancer Stemness Landscape**\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we tested the ability of our indices to identify previously unexplored features of cancer stemness across all TCGA tumors. First, we performed an enrichment analysis by sorting all TCGA samples by stemness index for each tumor type and looking for associations with mutations and molecular and clinical features. The most salient associations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi are presented, while the following results of the comprehensive analyses are shown in the supplementary material: associations with mutations, associations with miRNA expression and protein abundance, associations with the tumor grading, and clinical outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Correlations of mRNAsi and mDNAsi with Mutations in Genes, miRNA, and Expression of Proteins**\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a strong association of mDNAsi with known molecular subtypes, with somatic mutations in SETD2 and TP53 genes, and with tobacco smoking status in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Current smokers and recently reformed smokers have higher mDNAsi than non-smokers or long-term reformed smokers. This suggests that the stemness of LUAD tumors might be activated in response to environmental stimuli such as smoking and might influence the aggressiveness of the tumor. We also found an association between mDNAsi and higher protein expression of CYCLINB1 and FOXM1, which is a pro-stemness transcription factor upstream of CYCLINB1. FOXM1 has been associated with dedifferentiation in pancreatic cancer cells, as well as tumor proliferation in the kidney and ovarian cancers. Our result suggests that it could be a driver of dedifferentiation and proliferation in breast and lung cancers. Stemness of LUAD tumors is also associated with lower expression of ANNEXIN-A1. ANNEXIN-A1 has been indicated as a differentiation marker in pancreatic and urothelial cancers; therefore, we suspect that the relationship between ANNEXIN and FOXM1 expression and tumor differentiation may extend to other tumor types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyses of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) samples revealed that high indices are correlated with NSD1 mutation, E-cadherin protein expression, miR-200-3p, and previously identified classical molecular subtypes. NSD1 mutation was recently linked in HNSC tumors to blockade of cellular differentiation and promotion of oncogenesis. Interestingly, miR-200 family members have been implicated in cancer initiation and metastasis, as well as self-renewal of healthy stem cells. HNSC tumors with high mDNAsi have reduced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) samples, we found an association between mRNAsi and high pathological grade. Negative associations between mRNAsi and the probability of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) were detected. In contrast to the majority of tumor types, LIHC samples with high mRNAsi have low expression of miR-200 family members. The miR-200 family is known to be associated with progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the miR-200b-ZEB1 circuit has been suggested as a master regulator of stemness in these cancers. We found associations of mRNAsi with higher CYCLINB1 and ACC1 and with lower PD-L1 and ANNEXIN-A1 protein expression in LIHC. ACC1 was associated with pathomorphological markers of LIHC aggressiveness (vascular invasion and poor differentiation), and its upregulation was correlated with poor OS and disease recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. LIHC samples with high mRNAsi were associated with specific genomic alterations (e.g., TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed analyses of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) samples revealed an association between high mRNAsi and defined molecular subtypes, clinical stage, and mutations in PRKAR1A and TP53 genes. We found a positive correlation between mRNAsi and adrenal differentiation score that is based on expression of 25 genes that are important for adrenal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stemness Indices Are Correlated with Tumor Pathology and Predictive of Clinical Outcome**\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed a positive correlation between tumor histology and pathology grading and both stemness indices for the majority of the TCGA cases. For mRNAsi, the most significant correlations were found for BRCA (IDC and ILC), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), LIHC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Interestingly, mRNAsi shows low values in GBM and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). On the other hand, mDNAsi strongly stratifies glioma by the pathology grade, culminating with the highest value for GBM. The reversed values of mDNAsi and mRNAsi in the case of gliomas were also evident in the clinical data analyses. We found a positive correlation between previously published glioma subtypes and mDNAsi, suggesting that mDNAsi might recapitulate prognostic molecular subtypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discordance between the mRNAsi and the mDNAsi for gliomas may be explained in part by the dominant genomic alteration associated with the LGG tumor type. Roughly 80% of LGG tumors carry an IDH1/2 mutation and, as demonstrated by our group and others, confer a genome-wide hypermethylator phenotype (G-CIMP). Given that the mDNAsi is driven primarily by low methylation levels associated with the stemness phenotype, the LGG tumors might resemble non-stem-like phenotypes, which are predominantly hypermethylated. The subgroup of G-CIMP with the lowest overall DNA methylation levels (G-CIMP low) is associated with the worst outcomes. Compared to G-CIMP-high tumors, G-CIMP-low tumors are known to be more proliferative, express cell-cycle-related genes, and have various stem-cell-like genomic features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cancer Stemness Indices Are Higher in Tumor Metastases and Reveal Intratumor Heterogeneity**\n",
      "\n",
      "The TCGA samples are derived mostly from primary tumors, except for skin melanoma, for which tissues are mostly metastatic lymph nodes. We used the mRNAsi to interrogate the MET500 dataset comprising expression profiles from 500 metastatic samples obtained from 22 different organs. In most cases, mRNAsi was significantly higher in metastatic samples compared to primary TCGA tumors. Prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastases had the most dedifferentiated phenotypes and are also more aggressive and resistant to therapies in contrast to primary tumors. Weaker association with the mRNAsi was due to a small number of available samples. Interestingly, testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) present the less differentiated phenotypes in primary tumors when compared to distant metastases. Primary TGCT tumor cells have high mRNAsi and may differentiate when metastasizing to distant organs. A similar trend was observed for STAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using another dataset, we found that mDNAsi was significantly higher in glioma samples obtained at first recurrence in contrast to primary gliomas. Our results reveal significant dedifferentiation of glioma cancer cells that contribute to glioma recurrence, which is frequently associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. By taking advantage of single-cell transcriptome datasets, we used mRNAsi to probe tumor heterogeneity for oncogenic dedifferentiation of individual cancer cells. We revealed high variation of stemness in the glioma and breast primary tumors. Individual glioma cells showed higher variation of oncogenic dedifferentiation in comparison to breast cancer cells. Single cells from metastases had higher stemness index in breast cancer. Interestingly, the negative correlation of EMT signature and stemness that we observed in TCGA primary tumors was also found in metastatic samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stemness Index Evaluated in the Context of Immune Response**\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that for many tumors, higher stemness indices are associated with a reduced leukocyte fraction and lower PD-L1 expression. For mDNAsi, the most distinctive negative correlations were found in the PanCan-12 squamous cluster (LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; HNSC; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma) and in GBM. For the mRNAsi, the highest negative correlation values were seen in GBM/LGG, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), LIHC, and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) tumors. We expect that such tumors will be less susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade treatments due to insufficient immune cell infiltration or preexisting downregulation of the PD-L1 pathway, which makes further inhibition ineffective. Our findings are consistent with previous reports showing a strong correlation between PD-L1 protein expression and infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We further explored correlations between stemness and immune microenvironment variables in the context of molecular subtypes of tumors. Several tumor types exhibit strong (positive or negative) correlations. Except for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), the association between stemness and PD-L1 expression and leukocyte fraction is readily apparent from the increasing and decreasing trends of individual variables across the molecular subtypes. For example, we found mesenchymal tumors to have the highest PD-L1 expression levels, the most significant leukocyte fractions, and the lowest mDNAsi compared to other HNSC subtypes, suggesting potential susceptibility to checkpoint blockade inhibitors. The use of immunotherapy for HNSC tumors is under active investigation with the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab; however, whether the effectiveness of therapy is limited to specific HNSC molecular subtypes is not clear from those reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assess other relationships between stemness and tumor microenvironment, we computed correlations between stemness indices and individual types of immune cells. By applying CIBERSORT, we scored 22 immune cell types for their relative abundance in TCGA tumor samples. These cell types included natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic and mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. We also obtained absolute estimates by scaling their relative abundance by overall leukocyte infiltration in each tumor as determined by ESTIMATE applied to DNA methylation data. For any given TCGA sample, we calculated the correlation between mDNAsi/mRNAsi and the estimated fraction of individual immune cell types. In addition to individual immune subpopulation fractions, we considered the functional activation of distinct cells by measuring the difference between activated and resting fractions of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. This approach was motivated by recent observations that activation of peripheral CD4+ T cells triggered by immunotherapy is responsible for the specific killing of tumor cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the squamous cluster tumors had a negative correlation between stemness and the fraction of CD4+ T cell populations, the activation state of the CD4+ T cells was higher in dedifferentiated tumors. This finding is consistent with our observation that PD-L1 protein expression is lower in these tumors, suggesting again that immune checkpoint blockade might be ineffective, and an additional mechanism of immune evasion may be operative. The opposite trend is present in thymomas, where PD-L1 protein expression and the fraction of the CD4+ T cell population are positively correlated with tumor dedifferentiation. Likewise, the activation state of CD4+ T cells is lower in dedifferentiated tumors, suggesting that they might be more susceptible to immunotherapy treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Connectivity Map Analysis Identifies Potential Compounds/Inhibitors Capable of Targeting the Stemness Signature**\n",
      "\n",
      "We employed the Connectivity Map (CMap), a data-driven, systematic approach for discovering associations among genes, chemicals, and biological conditions, to search for candidate compounds that might target pathways associated with stemness. We found enrichment for compounds associated with stemness in at least three cancer types. Five compounds are significantly enriched in more than 10 cancer types and have been reported to inhibit stemness-related tumorigenicity: the dopamine receptor antagonists thioridazine and prochlorperazine, the Wnt signaling inhibitor pyrvinium, the HSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin, and the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. Further, the telomerase inhibitor gossypol induced apoptosis and growth inhibition of cancer stem cells (CSCs), and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A (SAHA) reduced glioblastoma stem cell growth. According to our analysis, pyrvinium and puromycin could inhibit stemness in LUAD. We found several candidates with recognized anti-CSC activity for HNSC, including the aforementioned compounds. For LIHC, thioridazine, a prospective inhibitor of lung cancer stem cells, pyrvinium, puromycin, prochlorperazine, and others are potential compounds targeting undifferentiated tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMap mode-of-action (MoA) analysis of the 74 compounds revealed 56 mechanisms of action shared by the above compounds. Five compounds (fluspirilene, pimozide, prochlorperazine, thioridazine, and trifluoperazine) shared the MoA of dopamine receptor antagonist. We observed that entinostat, trichostatin-a, and vorinostat shared MoA as HDAC inhibitors, and LY-294002, zaprinast, zardaverine share MoA as phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMap target analysis revealed 212 distinct drug-target genes shared by the mentioned compounds. Eight genes are targets of five different compounds—namely, DRD2 (8 drugs), HTR2A (7 drugs), HRH1 (6 drugs), ADRA1A (5 drugs), CALM1 (5 drugs), CHRM3 (5 drugs), HTR1A (5 drugs), and HTR2C (5 drugs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent polypharmacology studies suggest the need to design compounds that act on multiple genes or molecular pathways. In this study, we observed similar mechanisms of action among different compounds, suggesting that selective therapies can target the undifferentiated phenotypes for selected cancer types.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "\n",
      "This study is based on integrated analysis of cancer stemness in almost 12,000 primary human tumors of 33 different cancer types. We interrogated TCGA data for mutations, DNA methylation, expression of mRNA and miRNA, expression and post-translational modification of proteins, histopathological grade, and clinical outcome. Applying CIBERSORT, we gained insight into the tumor microenvironment and composition of immune cell infiltrates. By applying a machine-learning algorithm to molecular datasets from normal stem cells and their progeny, we developed two different molecular metrics of stemness and then used them to assess epigenomic and transcriptomic features of TCGA cancers according to their grade of oncogenic dedifferentiation. Ultimately, the analyses led us to potentially actionable targets (and their MoAs) as candidates for possible differentiation therapy of solid tumors and metastases. Our approach could be applied to longitudinal study of samples from primary, recurrent, and metastatic cancers, and gene expression signatures identified in the tumor samples can be used to interrogate CMap to suggest actionable targets and inhibitors for further analysis.\n",

      "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which molecular PCBC datasets comprised of stem cells and defined populations of their differentiated progeny have been leveraged to develop a classification tool and machine-learning algorithm for analysis of a spectrum of human malignancies. A number of cancer stemness scores, based on genes that are differentially expressed between CSCs and non-CSCs, have been published and are relevant to clinical outcomes in AML (Eppert et al., 2011; Gentles et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2016). In those studies, gene sets enriched in ESCs (e.g., targets of NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and c-MYC) were frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors compared with well-differentiated ones. In breast cancers, those gene sets were associated with high-grade estrogen receptor-negative, basal-like tumors and poor clinical outcome (Ben-Porath et al., 2008). Another web-based tool, StemChecker, uses a curated set of 49 published stemness signatures defined by gene expression, RNAi screens, transcription factor binding sites, text mining of the literature, and other computational approaches. But it has been tested only for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In that case, high expression of stemness genes correlated with poor prognosis (Pintó et al., 2015). All previous studies were transcriptome-based and limited to a narrow set of genes and a small number of tumor types.\n",

      "In the present study, we found oncogenic dedifferentiation to be associated with several characteristics: mutations in genes that encode oncogenes and epigenetic modifiers, perturbations in specific mRNA/miRNA transcriptional networks, and deregulation of signaling pathways. Cancer stemness also appeared to involve core expression of MYC, OCT4, SOX2, and other genes involved in the regulatory circuitry that underlies normal and malignant self-renewal potential. Our indices derived from mRNA expression and DNA methylation signatures reliably stratified tumors of known stemness phenotype. High mRNAsi was associated with basal breast carcinomas but also Her2 and lumB subtypes that are more aggressive than the hormone-dependent lumA group. In contrast, high mDNAsi was strongly associated with high-grade glioblastomas, poor OS, and PFS. The association between stemness signatures and adverse outcome for some tumor types, including gliomas, may reflect malignant cell origins or the impact of their microenvironment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dedifferentiated cells can arise from different sources: from long-lived stem or progenitor cells that accumulate mutations in oncogenic pathways or via dedifferentiation from non-stem cancer cells that convert to CSCs through deregulation of developmental and/or non-developmental pathways. It is important to distinguish between the inherent stemness of CSCs and dedifferentiation induced by the tumor microenvironment. However, addressing that issue would require further validation beyond the scope of this study using other genomic datasets and/or laboratory experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both stemness indices were lowest in normal cells, increased in primary tumors, and highest in metastases, consistent with the idea that tumor progression generally involves oncogenic dedifferentiation. Interestingly, we observed negative associations between stemness and EMT gene signatures. The relationship between EMT and stemness remains a hotly debated topic, with several studies showing that EMT is necessarily associated with stemness (Fabregat et al., 2016). However, most TCGA data are obtained from primary tumors, which exist in a pre-EMT state, since EMT is strongly associated with tumor progression and with metastasis for many tumor types. Cancer cells in many primary solid tumors are basically epithelial regardless of their degrees of dedifferentiation, but some cells in such contexts could acquire mesenchymal characteristics either by accumulating additional mutations or by undergoing epigenetic changes shaped by the tumor microenvironment. Those mesenchymal cells can traverse the underlying tissue, enter the bloodstream, and seed distant organs, where they reacquire an epithelial phenotype to form metastatic tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed epithelial phenotypes and increased stemness index in molecular profiles of tumor-type-matched metastatic samples in the MET500 cohort. This portends an association between dedifferentiation and spread of tumor cells to distant organs. The observation is further supported by high mDNAsi in samples from recurrent gliomas. It appears that tumor growth de novo, or at recurrence/metastasis, is associated with an increased stemness phenotype. Decreased mRNAsi levels seen in TGCT suggest its possible differentiation as a germ cell tumor type induced by the microenvironment of liver or lung parenchyma, the organs it most often colonizes. Clinically, in general, tumor progression is associated with greater aggressiveness and resistance to therapy of almost all types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mRNAsi was high for individual primary glioma and breast cancer cells. Interestingly, when applied to transcriptomic profiles obtained from analysis of single cancer cells in bulk tumors, stemness indices revealed a high degree of intratumor heterogeneity with respect to dedifferentiation phenotype. The heterogeneity was greater in gliomas than in breast cancer, suggesting that intratumor environment, including stromal cells, hypoxia, and infiltration of immune cells, may play a role in shaping CSC niches and affect cancer cell developmental plasticity. Further molecular analyses of cancer cells stratified by the stemness phenotype would provide novel insights into the biology of primary tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that for a number of tumor types (GBM, LUSC, HNSC, and BLCA), higher mDNAsi was associated with reduced leukocyte fraction and/or lower PD-L1 expression. Such tumors are expected to be less susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade, due either to insufficient immune cell infiltration of tumors or to inherent downregulation of the PD-L1 pathway. Both factors can render immune checkpoint immunotherapy ineffective. The interaction between PD-L1 on cancer cells and PD1 receptor on T cells helps cancer cells elude the immune system by preventing activation of cytotoxic T cells in lymph nodes and subsequent recruitment of other immune cell types to the tumor site (Chen and Mellman, 2013). The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and/or PD-L1 expression correlates with aggressiveness in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Bertucci et al., 2015) and breast carcinomas (Poloñia et al., 2017). Common features shared between cancer cells and stem cells in the context of the immune response are being highlighted by a growing number of studies showing that vaccination with ESCs or iPSCs can raise specific immune response against cancer cells (Kooreman et al., 2018). That finding may indicate that both cell populations use protein networks that, in tumors, result in uncontrolled self-renewal and dedifferentiated phenotypes histopathologically defined by loss of architecture specific to the tissue of origin. We speculate that the indices described here may help predict the efficacy of stem-cell-based immunotherapies and contribute to the identification of patients who will respond to such therapies.\n",

      "We interrogated CMap using the gene expression signatures from tumor samples with the highest and lowest mRNAsi levels. Surprisingly, the CMap analysis, which is based on only a limited number of treated cell lines, very precisely selected drugs that have been shown to affect cancer stem cells with specificity. These translational analyses may ultimately pave the way for implementation of differentiation therapies for solid tumors. Here, we have also shown that cancer hallmarks can be extracted from datasets on cells with defined phenotypes and used to train machine-learning methods applicable to index molecular profiles of cancer. Our mRNAsi and mDNAsi can be translated into stemness scores (e.g., STEM50) that stratify tumors based on their dedifferentiation features, thus providing biomarkers for prediction of patient outcomes and response to differentiation therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By defining new metrics of cancer stemness and using them to interrogate TCGA datasets, our results provide a comprehensive characterization of dedifferentiation as new and significant hallmarks of cancer. The strengths of the approach are that it leverages features of dedifferentiated cells across a spectrum of tumor types that reflect tumor pathology and, in some cases, clinical outcome. This study also provides strategies for integrated analysis of cancer genomics based on machine-learning methods trained on molecular profiles obtained from cells with defined phenotypes. The findings based on those methods may advance the development of objective diagnostics tools for quantitating cancer stemness in clinical tumors, perhaps leading eventually to new biomarkers that predict tumor recurrence, guide treatment selection, or improve responses to therapy.\n"
